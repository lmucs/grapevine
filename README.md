# Grapevine


Grapevine is an application that automatically populates a user's calendar with events from Twitter and Facebook. Events are extracted by an intelligent agent that listens to feeds that the user follows.

## Extracting Events
Users provide Grapevine with a list of feeds on Facebook and Twitter that they wish to follow. We pull any new posts and tweets from Facebook and Twitter and identify meaningful events.

 If there is a date in the post, then it is an event.

If it finds any events, it stores them and pushes the events to the user. These events are put on the user's Grapevine calendar.

TODO - Insert calendar views of the same event for Android, iOS, and web.

Events have information such as start time and end time, tags, who posted the event, and a link to the original post.




TODO - server info, App Store / Google Play info

TODO - getting your own installation, npm install ....
